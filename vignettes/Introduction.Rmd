# General information

The WID-BC-index is computed using methylation data to highlight the potential epigenetic risk score. 

The package is aimed to enable research use of the WID-BC-index by facilitating computation from methylation data.

The input is a beta methylation matrix, for instance derived after quality control and normalisation of data obtained from the Illumina MethylationEPIC (preferred) or Illumina Methylation450k Array (caveat: not all WID-BC-index CpGs are represented on the 450k array). 

The use is as follows:

`WID_BC(beta)`
